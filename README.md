### Hello, this is Alejandro (he/him)

I am a programmer, mainly in python, aspiring to be able to work as a developer and DevOps. I also know languages like C# or C++, although I have had contact with Rust and Golang. I also like a lot to tinker with multimedia oriented computing.

My main project at this day is Compyter Stats, a web application for monitoring a network of devices, tracking their resources, like CPU usage, process list... This project uses Python, Django and MySQL. I tried to cover as many technologies as possible so I have an opportunity to master them.
