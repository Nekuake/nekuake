### Hello, this is Alejandro (he/him)

A developer focused on creating automatic and easy solutions, as well as mantaining complex systems which need to be always ready to shine! My main language is Python but I always like to dip my toes in other languages and technologies. Worked with C# but also Rust, and Golang. I also like a lot to tinker with multimedia oriented computing.

The project I'm working more actively right now is ComPyter Stats, a web application for monitoring a network of devices, tracking their resources, like CPU usage, process list... This project uses Python, Django and MySQL. I tried to cover as many technologies as possible so I have an opportunity to master them.

## Always open to learn new and exciting things.
